A powershell script to export Windows 10 lock screen pictures

This is a "fork" of Anders Rodland's powershell script, available here: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Get-Windows-10-Lock-Screen-61dc8ffa

I've added a width / height comparison, so only landscape wallpapers will be extracted. 

# usage

Download the powershell script, save it somewhere, right click and run with powershell
